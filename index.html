<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>As Lennox grows and looks to the future, PorchLight was contracted to assess the upcoming housing needs of the community.</p>
<p>To conduct this assessment, PorchLight analyzed existing data, conducted a visual inspection of housing structures in town, and collected input through input interviews and a survey in the community. Throughout this process, we found a committed, intentional community where most stakeholders feel things are headed in the right direction. There are certainly areas of growth for Lennox to tackle over the next 10 years, but we found a community ready to do so. This report analyzes the period from 2023-2033.</p>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on our demographic modeling, we expect Lennox’s population to increase from 2,587 in the projection’s base year of 2023 to 3,098 by 2033.</li>
<li>Low-income renters in Lennox are experiencing an affordability crisis, with most renters with a household income below $50,000 cost-burdened, paying more than 30% of their income in rent.</li>
<li>Right now, mobile homes in Lennox are filling some of the gap for low-income households in Lennox, but mobile homeowners are struggling to keep up with repairs, leading to conflict with neighbors and the city.</li>
<li>Overall, owner-occupied housing is affordable and available in Lennox, and new housing is being built at an appropriate rate to accommodate population growth. However, for low-income households, finding affordable owner-occupied or rental units is a struggle.</li>
<li>Nearly a quarter (24.1%) of Lennox’s households make $75,000-$99,999, compared to 13.8% statewide, and Lennox has a higher median income than the state of South Dakota as a whole but a lower mean income, meaning the typical household in Lennox has slightly higher income than the typical household in South Dakota, but Lennox has fewer very-high income households.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our research and analysis, we recommend the following:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Lennox should focus on delivering more rental housing for the community over the next ten years. Specifically, 156 multi-family units.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Lennox should continue building owner-occupied housing targeted toward middle-income households. Specifically, 267 owner-occupied units, most of which being single-family homes.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Lennox should preserve its small-town character through managed growth and proactive code enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Lennox should create a collaborative remediation process for mobile homes that balances compliance with affordability.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Lennox should invest in community amenities that grow alongside new housing.</p>
<p>Read on through the rest of the report for our recommendations, a detailed housing needs analysis, and an appendix full of detail and additional analysis.</p>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>Based upon the analysis and research contained in this report, we recommend the following for Lennox, SD.</p>
<p><strong>1. Lennox should focus on delivering more rental housing for the community over the next ten years.</strong><br>
Lennox should target delivering 156 multi-family rental units by 2033, compared to a 2023 baseline. The greatest unmet need is among lower-income households, so future development will require partnerships with income-qualified or affordable rental housing providers. This could include organizations that deliver income-based housing, such as those supporting Section 8 vouchers or Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) projects.</p>
<p>However, there is also some need for rental units in Lennox’s largest household income bracket ($75,000-100,000). All rental households in this income bracket currently pay less than 20% of their income on rent, indicating they are likely generating pressure on the market by competing with lower-income households for the same units. Generating some higher-quality rental stock specifically targeted at this income band could help to relieve pressure in the rental market.</p>
<p>As new units are introduced, consideration should be given in location and design to ensure they fit well into the community.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lennox should continue building owner-occupied housing targeted toward middle-income households.</strong><br>
Lennox should aim to maintain its current pace of owner-occupied home construction, targeting 267 owner-occupied units built from 2023-2033. From 2022-2024, Lennox permitted 84 new single-family housing units, or approximately 28 per year, which is slightly ahead of a ten-year pace of 26.7 units per year.</p>
<p>In particular, Lennox should prioritize homes for the $75,000-$100,000 household income bracket. This income group is over-represented in Lennox compared to the state of South Dakota and represents the median of household incomes in Lennox. Building for this demographic ensures that families can continue to put down long-term roots in the community and that Lennox remains competitive for working households seeking ownership opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>3. Lennox should preserve its small-town character through managed growth and proactive code enforcement.</strong><br>
Residents of Lennox consistently expressed their desire to maintain a safe, tight-knit community. Lennox has grown at a deliberate rate of 2–3% annually, which has allowed the city to expand without losing its small-town identity. Continuing this pace of growth will help avoid the sense that the community is changing too quickly and allow it to keep up with necessary infrastructure and amenity investments. At the same time, Lennox’s strong approach to code enforcement has helped preserve housing quality and should remain a key priority. Homes in good condition are more likely to remain in the housing stock and be passed on to future generations. As housing construction costs continue to rise, keeping older housing stock active should be a key affordability priority.</p>
<p><strong>4. Lennox should create a collaborative remediation process for mobile homes that balances compliance with affordability.</strong><br>
Low-income residents in Lennox utilize mobile homes to attain housing, but there is tension between the city’s high standards for property maintenance and the financial limitations of mobile home residents. We recommend a clear and consistent process that allows mobile home residents—whether or not they own the land beneath their home—to understand specific code violations and develop reasonable, individualized remediation plans on a realistic timeline. These plans should be structured to reflect both the city’s expectations and the financial realities of residents. For now, mobile homes are some of the only attainable housing for low-income residents in Lennox, who fill critical service positions related to small-town amenities and services and need somewhere to live. As more rental options come online, the pressure on mobile homes as the only affordable option may decrease.</p>
<p><strong>5. Lennox should invest in community amenities that grow alongside new housing.</strong><br>
As housing is added, the city should continue investing in its parks, public spaces, and neighborhood amenities. Lennox has already demonstrated intentionality with efforts to ensure a park within half a mile of every home. Focus on parks, swimming facilities, restaurants, and other quality-of-life features will ensure that Lennox remains a place where residents can meet their daily needs locally and feel connected to the community—not simply a commuter town serving Sioux Falls.</p>

<h1>Housing Needs Analysis</h1>
<p>To project future housing needs for Lennox, PorchLight analyzed available data using our custom housing model built for rural communities and small towns.</p>
<p>The owner-occupied and rental analyses each includes a summary of the modeling by scenario, a high-level look at the expected change in housing units required, and a summary table showing the net change required by 2033 compared to 2023.</p>
<section id="owner-occupied-housing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="owner-occupied-housing">Owner-Occupied Housing</h2>
<p>The blue chart shows the modeling PorchLight conducted to estimate demand for owner-occupied housing units in 2033. We first look at current households by income, then adjust for anticipated changes in age cohorts and income, and finally adjust for ideal vacancy rates.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Demand Model" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-9gza7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9gza7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="822" height="206" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>The yellow chart shows the modeling PorchLight conducted to estimate supply for owner-occupied housing units in 2033. We first look at the number of housing units in 2023 and then adjust for how many of those housing units will be obsolete in 2033, based on the age of each unit and regional data for rural communities based on United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Components of Inventory Change (CINCH) data.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Supply Model" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-BUwUk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BUwUk/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="822" height="182" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Based on the above modeling, this table presents the net need for units to supply each income category.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Supply vs. Demand" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-pWlbF" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pWlbF/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="210" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>For income categories that have a net negative demand for units, this does not mean those units need to be demolished or taken offline. It just means that Lennox should account for lower demand in surrounding income categories.</p>
<p>In total, Lennox needs 267 owner-occupied units by 2033.</p>
<iframe title="Owner-Occupied Supply vs. Demand" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-MLdFk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MLdFk/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="578" height="474" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Lennox’s largest need for owner-occupied housing is for houses affordable for households making $75,000 to $99,999. This is the income band that contains the mean and median incomes for Lennox, and it is the income band where Lennox most differs from the state of South Dakota, with 24.1% of households in Lennox making $75,000 to $99,999 while only 13.8% of households in South Dakota are in that income band. (<a href="#e.-income-data">See Appendix E. Income Data</a>)</p>
<p>Lennox also has significant owner-occupied needs in the $100,000-$149,999 and $150,000+ income ranges.</p>
<p>The only income band where additional units are not required are for households making $34,999 and below.</p>
<p>Overall, on net, Lennox should be looking to see 267 new housing units over the ten-year period of 2023-2033.</p>
<iframe title="Lennox, SD Owner-Occupied Housing Unit Type Mix" aria-label="Grouped Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-vdGU9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vdGU9/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="474" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Based on PorchLight’s modeling, 254 of those units should be single-family homes and 13 should be multi-family units.</p>
<p>Changing interest rates and household-specific down payment amounts make home prices required for specific incomes highly variable. Because the interest rate environment over the life of this report is variable, we do not provide recommendations for specific home prices. For individuals building their own homes, the owner-occupied market will take care of itself, as long as they can secure land and builders. However, for spec homes, townhomes, etc., builders will need to assess the financial environment and market as they prepare a specific project.</p>
<p>Use this calculator to get a sense of what these income bands translate to in terms of purchasing power.</p>

<p>For income categories that have a net negative demand for units, this does not mean those units need to be demolished or taken offline. It just means that Lennox should account for lower demand in surrounding income categories.</p>
<p>In total, Lennox needs 156 rental units by 2033 according to the base model.</p>

<p>The largest need for rental units is for households making less than $15,000 annually. Our model anticipates there will be 80 households in Lennox making less than $15,000 in 2033, but only 13 units affordable for those households. Building rental housing stock for households with very low incomes is very challenging and is a need for many communities. Providing affordable housing stock for households at this income level will almost certainly require subsidized housing. Right now, all rental households making less than $10,000 in Lennox are cost-burdened (meaning they pay more than 30% of their income on rent) or severely cost-burdened (meaning they pay more than 50% of their income on rent). In fact, most rental households in Lennox making less than $49,999 are cost-burdened. (Appendix D. Housing Costs)</p>

<p>Based on PorchLight’s modeling, new rental units creation should be entirely focused on multi-family construction, for a total of 156 new multi-family rental units from 2023-2033.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-population-data-and-trends">A. Population Data and Trends</h2>
<p>To understand current population patterns in Lennox, PorchLight analyzed 10-year age groups to understand age-based population inflows and outflows.</p>
<p>To understand how this analysis works, it is easiest to consider a specific age group. For example, consider the cohort born in or after 1998, who will be aged 35-44 in 2033. Hover over “1998: 35-44” in the chart’s key to see this cohort highlighted. In 2013, this cohort was aged 15-24 and there were 195 of them in Lennox. Ten years later, this cohort was aged 25-34 and numbered 416. To estimate the size of this cohort in 2033, we look at the 1988 cohort, which increased by 21.5% when aging from ages 25-34 to 35-44, and assume the 1998 cohort will follow a similar in-migration pattern as they go through that same age transition. Some age groups will see increases and some will see decreases, and this modeling process helps us understand those age-specific changes based on the demographic push and pull factors of Lennox. In the case of the 1998 cohort, we project that in 2033, as they reach the ages 34-44, there will be 506 of them.</p>

<p>In 2013, the population of Lennox was 2,036. In 2023, 2,587. We estimate that by 2033 the population of Lennox will increase to 3,097.</p>
<p>Communities in the Sioux Falls metro area have generally seen their populations increase over the past ten years. This chart shows how growth in Lennox compares to other communities that surround Sioux Falls.</p>

<p>In 2023, Lennox (pop. 2,097) sat fairly evenly in population between Hartford (pop. 2,686) and Crooks (pop. 1,557), but over the past decade Lennox’s growth has put it much more neatly into the grouping of larger, growing communities near Sioux Falls.</p>

<p>Looking at the actual number of new residents per year, the relationship between proximity to Sioux Falls and net population increase is evident. Lennox slightly outperforms this trend with an average population increase of about 49 new residents per year. For context, Sioux Falls is adding an average of 3,997 residents per year.</p>

<p>For Lennox, $50,000 is the key threshold for renters. For households making $50,000 or more in Lennox, there are more units affordable at that income than households. However, for households with an income below $50,000, there are more households at a particular income level than there are units affordable to that income.</p>
<p>This is borne out in the housing affordability data, as seen in the chart below. All rental households in Lennox with an income of $50,000 or more spend less than 30% of their income on rent. However, most households in Lennox making less than $50,000 are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30% of their income on rent. Some households making less than $20,000 spent more than half of their income on rent, meaning they are severely cost-burdened.</p>
<p>There are some very low-income households in Lennox that pay an affordable amount for rent, but this is not the case for most low-income households in Lennox.</p>

<p>Across the board in Lennox, there are more occupied units affordable at any particular income level than there are households at that income level, indicating that overall households are paying an affordable amount for their owner-occupied units.</p>
<p>Household-level affordability data in the chart below provides a bit more context on the owner-occupied housing market in Lennox. 68% of owner-occupied households in Lennox pay less than 20% of their income for housing, and only 7% of owner-occupied households are cost-burdened. In a rural community like Lennox, many households seek a lower cost of living, particularly around housing, so while many households could afford to be paying more for housing, they may choose not to upgrade, even if they could afford it.</p>

<p>Some owner-occupied households are cost-burdened in Lennox, but overall this does not seem to be a systemic problem. Households with a mortgage with an income of less than $35,000 are all cost-burdened and likely do not see more affordable options in the rental market, as that market is also generally unaffordable for households with lower incomes in Lennox.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ii.-location-quotient-and-shift-share-analysis">ii. Location Quotient and Shift Share Analysis</h3>
<p>To understand the economic trends in Lennox, PorchLight conducted an economic analysis of major industries, comparing Lennox to the United States as a whole and looking at changes over a ten-year period.</p>
<p>First, PorchLight analyzed the Location Quotient for each category of industry in Lennox. Location Quotient compares the prevalence of a particular industry in Lennox compared to the nation. A location quotient higher than one (1) means an industry is more prevalent proportionally in the local area compared to the national average, and a location quotient below one (1) means the industry is less prevalent proportionally compared to the national average.</p>
<p>The following chart demonstrates how the Location Quotient of each industry in Lennox changed from 2013 to 2023. For example, in 2013, “Educational services, and health care and social assistance” in Lennox was about 0.98 times as prevalent compared to the national average, whereas by 2023 that had increased to 1.24 times the national average.</p>
<iframe title="Change in Location Quotient" aria-label="Arrow Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-vcPaC" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vcPaC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="726" height="449" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Additionally, PorchLight conducted a shift-share analysis of industries in Lennox to provide more detail on why some industries have more or fewer jobs than a decade ago. The shift-share analysis considers three things that affect changes in jobs: the effect of national job growth, the effect of industry mix, and the local share effect.</p>
<p>National growth looks at the overall 10-year job growth rate across all industries. For 2013-2023, that was 13%, so we assume, all else being equal, 13% of job growth in each industry is not specific to any industry.</p>
<p>Industry mix looks at each industry on a national level, assuming that local industry in Lennox is affected by similar forces that affect their industry across the country. This varies by industry.</p>
<p>After accounting for national growth and industry mix, we look at the local share effect. This is what is happening locally that is not explained by national growth or overall industry mix.</p>
<iframe title="Lennox, SD Shift-Share Analysis" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-pi5cM" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pi5cM/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="782" height="873" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>Across all industries, we calculate the following shift-share totals.</p>
<p>National Growth Effect: 138</p>
<p>Industry Mix Effect: -9</p>
<p>Local Share Effect: 107</p>
<p>= <strong>Total Local Employment Change 236 </strong></p>
<p>Overall, industry mix in Lennox opened up a minor vulnerability for Lennox, but Lennox outperformed national trends, seeing significant job growth due to local effects, particularly in healthcare/education and professional services.</p>

<section id="g.-vacancy-rates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="g.-vacancy-rates">G. Vacancy Rates</h2>
<p>According to the American Community Survey, in 2023, 36 housing units in Lennox were vacant. Of those, 0 were available for rent, 0 were rented, but not occupied, 0 were for sale, and 0 were sold, but not occupied. 36 were vacant and not on the market. (B25004)</p>
<p>With no houses for sale or rent in Lennox, US Census data would indicate a 0% vacancy rate. However, PorchLight’s visual inspection (conducted in 2025) identified 22 houses for sale out of 761 single family housing units, indicating a vacancy rate of 2.45%. For owner-occupied units, we recommend a target vacancy rate of around 2%.</p>
<iframe title="Vacancy Targets: Lennox, SD" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-psYWe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/psYWe/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="209" data-external="1"></iframe>
<p>A 2% vacancy rate for owner-occupied housing demonstrates some availability in the market without a significant number of vacant properties. The typical American homeowner spends <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/resources/home/average-length-of-homeownership">about 13 years</a> in their home, and <a href="https://www.quickenloans.com/learn/timeline-for-selling-a-house">up to 90 days</a> on the market is considered an appropriate amount of time for a home to sell. Taking these factors into account, a home following a typical homeownership cycle will spend about 2% of time vacant. This indicates appropriate housing availability without long-term vacant housing.</p>
<p>With Lennox’s active construction of housing, it is generating enough housing to maintain a healthy vacancy rate.</p>
<p>For renter-occupied units, we recommend a target vacancy rate of 5-8%. Rental units experience higher turnover and provide necessary slack in the housing market. A 5-8% vacancy rate indicates the average rental unit spends one month vacant every 12-20 months.</p>
<p>Lennox has very low rental vacancy, clearly below the recommended 5-8% vacancy rate, indicating a need for additional units.</p>

<section id="h.-building-permits" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="h.-building-permits">H. Building Permits</h2>
<p>From 2022-2024, Lennox permitted 104 new housing units, 84 of which were single-family structures and 20 of which were multi-family units (quadplexes).</p>

<p>Based on building permit data, the average construction cost from 2022-2024 for single-family homes increased from $263,000 to $308,000, though the median cost only increased from $247,000 to $259,000. This indicates that more high-end homes are being built in Lennox, but the actual cost to build a typical home has not significantly increased.</p>
<p>Lennox did not see a significant number of multi-family units built from 2022-2024, but the quadplexes built in 2024 demonstrate how multi-family units provide a more affordable pathway to housing supply at a cost of just over $200,000 per unit.</p>

<p>Overall, input from a variety of sources indicated that housing in Lennox is affordable and available. “I think they’re as affordable as you can expect them to be in the region,” said one interviewee. While construction and labor costs are similar to Sioux Falls, lower land costs in Lennox generate savings on housing prices.</p>
<p>However, particularly for lower-income households, affordability is a struggle in Lennox. “You have to have pretty solid dual income to be in the market” for the new-build homes in Lennox. One single mother who rents in Lennox stated, “I would love to buy a home in Lennox but houses here are way too expensive for a single mother budget.”</p>

<p>Overall, the sense is that there is a need for more rental units in Lennox. “We need apartments if we’re going to continue to grow and meet the workforce demands here,” said one interviewee. Demand is high, as people call city leadership “every week” asking, “Anybody have a rental available? Does anybody know of any rentals?”</p>
<p>Generally, renters who replied to a survey noted that their rent prices were “about right,” running from $660-$840 per month, but persistent complaints indicate that the main issue is finding an available rental.</p>
<p>Quality is a concern in the rental market in Lennox. One renter asked that the City “require inspections to make sure houses or rental units are up to code and safe. I think we have some landlords that need to put a little more effort into maintenance. Bats, other pests and mold need to be dealt with. One apartment in town has bat droppings down the side of the building and all over the sidewalk.”</p>

<section id="iii.-mobile-home-parks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="iii.-mobile-home-parks">iii. Mobile Home Parks</h3>
<p>Several participants described mobile homes in Lennox as serving the community’s workforce. One individual stated they are used by “people that work at [a gas station] or are teacher assistants and need some place to live,” with the demographic described as “working class,” noting that “80% would probably never leave” because “it’s his home” and residents have “lived there for decades.” A local employer reported managing multiple mobile homes to “get people into town to work,” with some employees later “buying a house in town.”</p>
<p>Mobile homes were described as offering a “decent sized home”—often three bedrooms and two bathrooms, or two bedrooms with a converted living room—at a lower cost than other housing types.</p>
<p>Park owners expressed frustration with the city’s approach to code enforcement, describing it as “very legalistic” and “unreasonably restrictive and invasive to people and their lives.” One noted that mobile homes are “judged differently than a regular house.” Participants contrasted Lennox with Sioux Falls, where they said the city offers grants of $2,000–$3,000 to assist with repairs like furnaces or siding. “There’s none of that here,” one person said. Another cited an instance where a single mother was required to complete $27,000 in exterior repairs, saying the city “didn’t care” about her financial situation.</p>
<p>The City of Lennox is “very serious about code enforcement” to improve “the general appearance and safety of the town.” The city has recommended non-renewal of licenses for some parks due to property conditions. Park owners reported that evictions, which can result from non-compliance, cost approximately $7,000 per unit and may result in the home being destroyed if the title cannot be obtained. One stated, “That’s completely wrong. But it’s the only legal way we have.”</p>
<p>Some owners described making significant investments in their parks, including “around $200,000 of our own money” on remodeling and new units, and another “$100,000” on infrastructure improvements like curb stops, which they said cost $3,000–$7,000 each. One noted, “That had never been done in the operating of 50 years here.” Several said they cover repair costs when residents cannot, such as frozen lines or providing paint for exterior upkeep. Conditions were said to vary by park, with one described as “in really good shape” and others characterized as “crammed” and lacking a consistent “standard of appearance.”</p>

<p>For now, leaders in Lennox view the growth of Sioux Falls as beneficial for Lennox, but far enough away to be manageable. Lennox is able to access labor shed benefits due to proximity to Sioux Falls, but land remains cheaper in Lennox and it is not experiencing the same explosive growth as Harrisburg or Tea.</p>
<p>Over time, interviewees expect the influence of Sioux Falls to grow, and the City is working to be proactively prepared for that. At the same time, leadership in Lennox is not seeking to grow faster than a rate of about three percent and find that manageable for now.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="v.-meeting-the-needs-of-seniors">v. Meeting the Needs of Seniors</h3>
<p>Previously, Lennox identified senior housing as a need for the community that it has worked to address. New builds, particularly slab-on-grade homes, have made it possible for seniors to find housing that meets their needs in Lennox. This has further expanded with new twin homes and quadplexes in the community. As these new housing opportunities have become available, seniors have moved out of older, multi-story housing, freeing up that housing for others to move into.</p>
<p>Seniors with ties to the community are motivated to stay in or return to Lennox. “I still think people want to be, you know, if you’ve always been here, mom and dad have always been here - there’s a nostalgia about making sure that they can live out their remaining years in Lennox.”</p>
<p>For most seniors, a variety of lawn care companies provide services like mowing and snow removal.</p>
<p>While there is one facility that “touts itself as being a kind of assisted living,” it is “unlicensed, unregulated” and minimally staffed. The community previously had a Good Samaritan facility but that was torn down several years ago.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i.-tapestry-based-housing-structure-preference-modeling">i. Tapestry-Based Housing Structure Preference Modeling</h3>
<p>This analysis estimates the likely demand for different housing structure types — single-family homes, multi-family units, and mobile homes — based on the demographic composition and housing tenure of Lennox households. The methodology draws from the American Community Survey (ACS) Table B25125: Tenure by Age of Householder by Units in Structure, which provides a detailed cross-tabulation of housing occupancy by tenure, age of householder, and structure type.</p>
<p>The model begins with a breakdown of housing units in Lennox by owner-occupied versus renter-occupied tenure and by three age brackets: 15–34 years, 35–64 years, and 65 years and older. Within each segment, housing units are further categorized by structure type (e.g., single-family detached or attached, small multi-family buildings, large multi-family buildings, mobile homes, and other units).</p>
<p>To infer household preferences by demographic segment, the model compares Lennox’s current housing distribution to that of peer counties across South Dakota with similar Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). These rural peer benchmarks are used to estimate the structure types typically occupied by households of similar age and tenure in comparable settings.</p>
<p>This comparative analysis yields an implied “tapestry” of preferred housing structures by demographic segment. The model then blends that expected demand based on rurality and age categories with the current housing type mix in Lennox to account for local preferences.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ii.-limitation-of-census-data-in-rural-communities">ii. Limitation of Census Data in Rural Communities</h3>
<p>The United States Census American Community Survey (ACS) provides critical, granular data related to housing and population for rural communities. At the same time, this data is imperfect. Year-by-year data is based on sampling over a 5-year period, and margins of error are high in rural communities. Reproducing or finding this level of data would be nearly impossible without the American Community Survey, so its limitations are worth it for the data it can provide.</p>
<p>PorchLight works to collect additional data in the communities where we work, including through community interviews, to ensure this data aligns with the reality on the ground.</p>
